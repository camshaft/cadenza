//! xtask — the one interface for driving the workspace.
//!
//! Deliberately minimal: today it builds the value-heap runtime component, content-addresses it,
//! and stores it. The runtime is derived FIRST and keyed by its SHA-256 (the recorded hashing
//! choice, options/hashing-and-encoding/), which is what the host resolves a program's required
//! runtime against (reproducible-derivation.md §Derivation Is A Function Of Source And Toolchain).
//!
//! The source-generation choreography (WIT envelope, opcode/frame tables) that used to live here
//! was stripped out — its outputs are now frozen, hand-maintained sources in the seed crates. Recover
//! the generators from git history if we decide to re-derive them.
//!
//! Every command is parsed with clap — typed subcommands, generated `--help`, and an error on an
//! unknown subcommand/flag.
//!
//! Usage: `cargo xtask build [--store <dir>]`.
