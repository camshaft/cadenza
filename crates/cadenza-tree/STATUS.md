# cadenza-tree Status

## Completed Features

- ✅ Two-layer architecture (green tree + red tree)
- ✅ String interning with O(1) comparisons
- ✅ Token caching and deduplication
- ✅ Node caching for structural sharing
- ✅ Optimized text() method (avoids allocation for single-token nodes)
- ✅ Source file tracking infrastructure
- ✅ Line number computation support
- ✅ Metadata system foundation

## Known Issues

## Known Issues

None! All tests pass. 🎉

## Resolved Issues

### ✅ Checkpoint Implementation (Previously 25 test failures)

**Resolution**: Studied Rowan 0.16 source code and reimplemented checkpoints to match exactly:

- Changed from nested stack architecture to flat children vector
- Checkpoint now stores position in children vector (not children count in current node)
- `start_node_at` pushes parent at checkpoint position
- This matches Rowan's implementation in builder.rs line-for-line

**Result**: All 383 cadenza-syntax tests now pass, including all previously failing checkpoint-related tests.

## Future Architectural Improvements

### Slot Map Architecture (Deferred)

**Current**: Nodes use `Arc<SyntaxNode>` for parent pointers
**Proposed**: Use slot map with node IDs

**Benefits**:

- Smaller nodes (just an ID + Arc to shared state)
- Single Arc for entire tree's metadata
- More cache-friendly

**Tradeoffs**:

- Adds indirection on every node access
- Requires redesigning parent/child relationships
- All traversal code needs updates

**Status**: Deferred until after checkpoint bug is fixed

### Synthetic/Virtual Tokens

**Status**: Structure in place but not fully implemented

**TODO**:

- Add zero-width token support
- Ensure they don't affect text ranges
- Add tests for synthetic tokens

### AnyMap for Node Metadata

**Status**: Infrastructure exists but not exposed in API

**TODO**:

- Add `NodeMetadata::set_data/get_data` methods
- Implement AnyMap storage
- Add examples and tests

## Testing Status

- **cadenza-tree**: 24/24 tests pass ✅
- **cadenza-syntax**: 383/383 tests pass ✅
- **cadenza-markdown**: 24/24 tests pass ✅
- **cadenza-gcode**: 21/21 tests pass ✅
- **All other crates**: Build successfully ✅

## Performance Notes

- String interning makes token comparisons O(1)
- Single-token text() avoids allocation (common case)
- Token cache prevents duplicate allocations
- Node cache enables structural sharing

## Migration from Rowan

- ✅ API compatibility maintained
- ✅ GreenNodeBuilder API similar to Rowan
- ✅ SyntaxNode/SyntaxToken types match Rowan patterns
- ⚠️ Checkpoint semantics differ (causing test failures)

## Dependencies

- rustc-hash: For fast hash maps
- No external tree library dependencies (Rowan removed)
