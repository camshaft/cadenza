error: fallible pattern in let binding
 --> test.cdz:1:5
  |
1 | let [x, y] = my_list
  |     ^^^^^^ this pattern can fail to match
  |
  = note: list patterns are fallible because list length is not known at compile time
  = note: let bindings require infallible patterns to prevent runtime panics
  = help: use a match expression to handle different list lengths:
  = help:   match my_list
  = help:     [x, y] => ...
  = help:     _ => ...
