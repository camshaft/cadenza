# Tuples - Ordered Collections
# Tuples group multiple values together into a single value

# Basic tuple with two elements (a pair)
let point = (3, 4)
point

# Empty tuple
()

# Single-element tuple (note the trailing comma)
(42,)

# Tuple with different types
let person = ("Alice", 30, true)
person

# Nested tuples
let matrix = ((1, 2), (3, 4))
matrix

# Tuples vs Lists
# Lists: [1, 2, 3] - homogeneous, mutable
# Tuples: (1, 2, 3) - can be heterogeneous, immutable

# Tuples are useful for returning multiple values
# (though Cadenza doesn't have tuple destructuring yet)
let coordinates = (10, 20, 30)
coordinates
