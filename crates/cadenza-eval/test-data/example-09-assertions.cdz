# Assertions - Runtime Checks
# 
# The assert macro allows you to verify conditions at runtime
# and provides detailed error messages when assertions fail.

# Basic assertion - verifies a condition is true
let x = 5
assert x > 0

# Assertion with custom error message
let value = 42
assert value == 42 "value must be 42"

# Assertions are useful for validating function inputs and outputs
fn divide a b =
    assert b != 0 "cannot divide by zero"
    a / b

divide 10 2

# Assertions help catch errors early in development
let result = divide 10 2
assert result == 5 "expected result to be 5"
