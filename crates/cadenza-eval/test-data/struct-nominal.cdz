# Test nominal typing - two structs with same structure should be different types
struct Point {
  x = Integer,
  y = Integer,
}

struct Vector {
  x = Integer,
  y = Integer,
}

let p = Point { x = 1, y = 2 }
let v = Vector { x = 1, y = 2 }

# Points and vectors are different types even though they have the same fields
# This demonstrates nominal typing
p
v
