  # Cadenza build/test pipeline — Nix flake (N0 devShell + N1 runtime-store derivation).
  #
  # Increments of the Nix-flake pipeline migration (design: fleet/NIX-FLAKE-PIPELINE-SCOPING.md,
  # operator-committed 2026-08-02). The existing `xtask`/GHA pipeline stays the source of truth; the
  # flake makes each stage reproducible + shareable via the nix cache. Each derivation is TIGHTLY
  # SCOPED to exactly its package's inputs (operator directive 2026-08-02: fine-grained cache
  # invalidation), never a monolithic everything-depends-on-everything graph.
  #   N0  — `devShell` reproducing the CI toolchain (rustc pin + wasm-tools + cargo-component).
  #   N1  — `packages.runtime` + `packages.runtime-debug` + `packages.nfc` : the value-heap RELEASE and
  #         DEBUG-COUNTERS runtimes + the NFC component (cadenza:nfc, imported by the runtime, FINDING#23),
  #         built + stripped as NORMAL (input-addressed) derivations; `packages.*-hash` is the content
  #         address DERIVED from the built bytes (never asserted). `checks.*-hash-parity` verifies each
  #         equals its committed hash (REQUIRED_RUNTIME_HASH / DEBUG_RUNTIME_HASH / REQUIRED_NFC_HASH).
  #   N2  — `packages.reducer-guest` + `packages.cedar-guest` (+ `-hash` each) : the cdz-kernel
  #         reducer-guest and cdz-agent-host cedar-policy-guest wasm components built from source, same
  #         hash-falls-out shape.
  #   R2  — `packages.store` : every built component assembled into one content-addressed store dir
  #         (`<derived-hash>.wasm`), mirroring target/cadenza-store but built + addressed by nix.
  #   S1  — `packages.seed-compiler` : the NATIVE bootstrap toolchain (cdz + cdz-run binaries) via
  #         `buildRustPackage` (root Cargo.lock, tracked #1748). S2 cadenza-projects, S3 per-test skip.
  #   rcdzc-wasm — `packages.rcdzc-wasm` (+ `-hash`) : the compiler as a wasm32-wasip1 module for the
  #         agent kernel's blob store (v-agent-harness owns the store pointer + compile-effect ABI).
  #   S2  — `packages.example-project` (+ the `buildCadenzaProject` fn) : build a Cadenza project
  #         (Project.cdz + sources) through nix via the S1 compiler → its wasm.
  #   S3  — `testCadenzaProject` (+ `checks.example-project-tests`) : run a project's @tests through nix
  #         as a derivation — nix input-hashing SKIPS unchanged tests (cache hit), re-runs on a change.
  #         North star: nix builds every component + the compiler (native + wasm) + projects + runs tests
  #         with fine-grained skip-unchanged, all deterministically.
  #
  # The Rust toolchain is read DIRECTLY from `rust-toolchain.toml` (the load-bearing pin — the
  # recorded `REQUIRED_RUNTIME_HASH` is only reproducible on that exact rustc). `rust-toolchain.toml`
  # stays the single source of truth; the flake CONSUMES it via oxalica's rust-overlay, so there is
  # no second place to bump the version.

        # xtask/src/main.rs): the RELEASE runtime (what a shipped program pins + composes) and the
        # DEBUG-COUNTERS runtime (same code + the `live-objects` leak counter, `--features
        # debug-counters`, that a Perceus leak-check harness composes). Each is `cargo component
        # build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` on cdz-runtime (build-std +
        # panic=immediate-abort from its .cargo/config.toml, enabled on the stable pin via
        # RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1), then `wasm-tools strip -a` to drop the non-deterministic tool-version
        # `producers` sections. The stripped bytes ARE the content-addressed store artifact.
        #
        # DESIGN (operator north star 2026-08-03): the content hash is DERIVED FROM THE BUILT BYTES,
        # never asserted. So each runtime is a NORMAL (input-addressed) derivation — NOT a fixed-output
        # derivation with a pinned/read `outputHash`. The build produces the stripped wasm; the hash
        # FALLS OUT as `sha256(that output)`, exposed via `packages.*-hash`. Nothing in this file names
        # a 64-hex literal or reads one from `runtime_abi.rs` — `runtime_abi.rs`'s recorded hash becomes
        # a CONSUMER of this nix-built truth (a later increment inverts `xtask codegen` to read it),
        # not the source. The gate proving parity (nix hash == the committed REQUIRED_RUNTIME_HASH)
        # lives in `checks.*` below, comparing the DERIVED hash to what the build already records —
        # never a hand-maintained pin.
        #
        # A normal derivation has NO network, so cargo's deps are VENDORED offline (`importCargoLock`):
        #   - the runtime's own committed Cargo.lock (its crates.io closure), AND
        #   - the toolchain's rust-src `library/Cargo.lock` (build-std compiles core/alloc/panic_abort
        #     from source, and cargo resolves THEIR deps — e.g. libc — from that second lockfile; a
        #     hermetic sandbox has no `~/.cargo` cache, so this MUST be vendored too).
        # Both vendor dirs are merged (`symlinkJoin`) and wired via a `[source.crates-io]
        # replace-with` CARGO_HOME config; the build runs with `CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true` (NOT the
        # `--offline` flag — see the mkStripComponent buildPhase note on why the flag breaks the NFC WIT
        # dep resolution).
        #
