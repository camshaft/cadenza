  # Cadenza build/test pipeline — Nix flake (N0: devShell only).
  #
  # This is increment N0 of the Nix-flake pipeline migration (design:
  # fleet/NIX-FLAKE-PIPELINE-SCOPING.md, operator-committed 2026-08-02). N0 is INTENTIONALLY
  # MINIMAL: it provides a `devShell` that reproduces the CI toolchain and NOTHING ELSE — no
  # package derivations, no test runners, no store build. The existing `xtask`/GHA pipeline stays
  # the source of truth; the flake only makes the toolchain reproducible + shareable via the local
  # nix cache. Later increments add derivations (N1 store, N2 guest-wasm, N3 tests) — each TIGHTLY
  # SCOPED to exactly its package's inputs (operator directive 2026-08-02: fine-grained cache
  # invalidation), never a monolithic everything-depends-on-everything graph.
  #
  # The Rust toolchain is read DIRECTLY from `rust-toolchain.toml` (the load-bearing pin — the
  # recorded `REQUIRED_RUNTIME_HASH` is only reproducible on that exact rustc). `rust-toolchain.toml`
  # stays the single source of truth; the flake CONSUMES it via oxalica's rust-overlay, so there is
  # no second place to bump the version.

        # step (it invokes the toolchain for wasm32-wasip1 before producing the final
        # wasm32-unknown-unknown component). A rustup host has wasm32-wasip1 installed globally so the
        # gap is invisible there; a hermetic Nix devShell must add it explicitly or `cargo component
        # build` fails with "failed to find the `wasm32-wasip1` target". Adding a target does NOT

          #                   component` leaks from the host `~/.cargo/bin`, defeating hermeticity.
          #                   nixpkgs pins 0.21.1 — the exact version the recorded REQUIRED_RUNTIME_HASH
          #                   was produced with, so the devShell build reproduces the committed hash.
          # NOT added: anything a specific later derivation needs — those go in that derivation's
          # own inputs (N1+), not this shared shell, to keep cache invalidation fine-grained.
