; Sets — the third built-in collection beside List and Map, witnessing collections-and-text.md
; #Sets (set-collection decision, options/set-collection/). A Set is an UNORDERED collection of
; UNIQUE elements of one type: it contains each element at most once, two sets are equal exactly
; when they contain equal elements independent of insertion order, membership is a TOTAL predicate
; (never traps, and there is no positional access because a set is unordered), and iteration visits
; elements in a deterministic element-derived order agreeing with the canonical byte form. A Set is
; a PRIMITIVE collection, not a `Map<T, Unit>` and not a hand-deduped `List`: it rides the same
; deterministic-value-form machinery Map does (a fixed element-derived order, deterministic-value-
; form.md #Ordering Of Aggregate Members Is Fixed), so the junk unit values a `Map<T, Unit>` would
; carry never enter its equality or its byte form.
;
; The value form is `(Set.of (list …))` — the canonical written form, exactly as a byte sequence is
; `(Bytes.of (list …))` and a symbol is `(Symbol.of …)`. `Set` is an ordinary prelude record (like
; `Bytes`, `String`, `Symbol`), so `Set.of` is `(. Set of)`, `Set.contains` is `(. Set contains)`,
; and so on — member access into a prelude record, not new core syntax. A self-hosting compiler
; keys its free-variable sets, visited sets, and declared-capability sets on this form.
;
; Tagged `(needs sets)` — a fresh capability the seed does NOT realize (distinct from the realized
; `collections`, exactly as `symbols` is distinct from it): a later generation realizes the
; persistent-set runtime (the same ordered persistent structure the map runtime targets, with the
; value column dropped; options/realized-capability-set/). The seed does not realize `sets`, so its
; behavior gate SKIPS these — they pin the contract the realization must meet, not seed declines.
; (The tag must be a fresh capability, not `collections`: `collections` is realized, so the seed
; would RUN these and reject the unbound `Set` prelude name with a coded diagnostic — a gate FAIL —
; rather than skip. This is why `symbols`/`units-of-measure`/`binary-matching` each use their own
; unrealized tag.) Several cases are written in an equality position because a set is not yet a
; producible top-level value (mirroring the map cases in 05-compound-types.sexp); the equality still
; forces the set to be built, exercising the uniqueness and order-independence invariants.
