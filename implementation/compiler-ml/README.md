# The Cadenza compiler, written in Cadenza (ML surface)

A from-scratch port of the compiler into Cadenza itself, written in the **ML surface**, in *ideal
form* — the compiler you would write if the language were finished. The Rust reference compiler
(`implementation/seed/crates/rcdzc`) is the structural **guide**; this is not a transliteration but a
re-derivation in idiomatic Cadenza.

This is a deliberate **stress test of the language**. Where Cadenza cannot express something cleanly,
the rule is to **report the issue so it gets fixed** — either a fix landed in the seed `rcdzc`, or a
crisp repro filed — rather than contorting the code around a limitation. Friction found is a
deliverable.

## Toolchain

- Author `.cdz` files (ML surface). When unsure of syntax, generate the canonical form with
  `cdz convert <file>.sexp --from sexpr --to ml` — do not hand-transcribe nested `match`/patterns.
- **`cdz check file.cdz`** is the primary loop: every well-formedness fault as
  `file:line:col: severity [CODE]: message`, exit ≠ 0 on error. `--json` for structured output.
- To exercise the backend: `cdz convert file.cdz --to binary > file.bin && cdz compile file.bin -t wasm
  -o out.wasm` (compile is the full type-check + lowering).

## Structure (mirrors the rcdzc stages)

- `ast.cdz` — the AST datatype + pure traversals (the `ast.rs` analogue). One recursive sum; a node
  contains its children (no arena — the language has real recursive values). The leaf value variants
  are `Int`/`Str`/`Bool` alongside the `Name` identifier and the `List` form — the subset the pipeline
  observes so far; the richer wire leaves (Float, Char, Bytes, Sym, markers) join as passes read them.

Planned, following the rcdzc pipeline: decode (binary AST → `Ast`) · resolve · infer (Hindley-Milner)
· lower (→ core) · encode/emit. The compiler is fundamentally bytes → bytes.

### Decode — the current front (blocked on two seed issues, see the log)

`decode` reads the canonical binary AST (`implementation/seed/crates/rcdzc/src/codec.rs`: an 8-byte
version header, a leaf table, a struct table, a root id — all LEB128) into the recursive `Ast`. The
idiomatic-Cadenza job is to resolve the *flat wire arena* into a *recursive tree* (following struct
ids), which is the whole point of the "a node contains its children" design. The decode LOGIC is
proven (LEB128 varint reader, big-endian magnitude, per-leaf reader, struct reader, and the arena→tree
`build`/`build-list` all verified in isolation against real `cdz convert --to binary` bytes), but two
seed issues block landing it as a `.cdz` that compiles + runs end to end (both surfaced by decode; see
the log). Until they're resolved, decode reconstructs the full tree STRUCTURE + every Int/Bool leaf
exactly (so `node-count` and shape passes are correct); Name/Str leaf CONTENT is a placeholder.

## Language issues found (stress-test log)

- **FIXED** (seed `rcdzc` db.rs `scan_type_decl`): a `///` doc comment on a `type` declaration was
  mis-parsed — the ML reader attaches the doc as a `(doc …)` form after the type name, and the sum scan
  read it as a bogus `doc` variant (CDZ0201 "declared more than once"). Now the scan skips a leading
  `(doc …)`, mirroring how a `def`'s leading doc is stripped.
- **Note (not a bug):** author nested `match` via `sexpr → ml`; the reader resolves nesting by greedy
  last-arm absorption, so a hand-written inner `match` easily mis-attaches its catch-all to the outer
  match (CDZ0210 non-exhaustive + CDZ0213 unreachable). The printer's own output round-trips correctly.

- **OPEN (seed `rcdzc` — runtime `String.from-bytes` declines):** `String.from-bytes` (and the
  `Ast.decode` self-decode) only compute on a *compile-time-constant* `Bytes`; a runtime byte slice
  DECLINES ("String.from-bytes of a runtime byte sequence is not yet computed (constant Bytes only)",
  `lower.rs::lower_str_from_bytes` ~13051). A decoder reads a `Name`/`Str` leaf's bytes from a runtime
  buffer, so it cannot MATERIALIZE the string content — every real AST is full of `Name` leaves, so
  this blocks a faithful decode. The fix looks tractable and small: a runtime `String` IS the SAME flat
  UTF-8 byte-leaf as a runtime `Bytes` (`lower.rs` ~1664, `String.concat` on runtime strings lowers to
  `bytes-concat` over their byte leaves), so `String.from-bytes` on a runtime `Bytes` is nearly the
  IDENTITY on the byte handle, plus UTF-8 validation for the `Option`. Worth a dedicated increment.

- **OPEN (seed `rcdzc` — backend MISCOMPILE, silent):** a SELF-TAIL-RECURSIVE function that passes a
  TUPLE-PROJECTED SUM-HANDLE (`(. r 0)` where `r : (Tuple W …)` and `W` is a boxed sum) as a loop
  ITERATION ARGUMENT miscompiles — the value is silently wrong (a `match` on it reads 0). `cdz check`
  is CLEAN → a lowering/codegen bug, not a type error. Root-caused to the SELF-TAIL-CALL LOOP TRANSFORM
  (`backend/wasm/select.rs::emit_loop_iteration`, the loop back-edge that evaluates the new arg values
  and stores them into the param slots). Minimal repro (`--arg 0` returns 0, must be 5), in
  `repros/miscompile-tail-loop-projected-sum-arg.sexp`:
  ```
  (do
    (type W (Atom Int64) (Node (List Int64)))
    (def (one (: b Bytes) (: pos Int64))
      (if (= (Option.expect (Bytes.at b pos) "t") 0)
        (tuple ((. W Atom) (Option.expect (Bytes.at b (+ pos 1)) "v")) (+ pos 2))
        (tuple ((. W Atom) 99) (+ pos 2))))
    (def (loop (: b Bytes) (: pos Int64) (: n Int64) (: last W))     ; self-tail-recursive → LOOP
      (if (= n 0) last (let ((r (one b pos))) (loop b (. r 1) (- n 1) (. r 0)))))  ; (. r 0) : W arg
    (def (wval (: s W)) (match s (((. W Atom) li) li) (((. W Node) ids) 0)))
    (def (main (: pos Int64)) (wval (loop b"\x00\x05\x00\x07" pos 1 ((. W Atom) 0))))
    (export main))
  ```
  Two CONTROLS both return 5 (in `repros/`): `miscompile-CONTROL-nontail-recursion-ok.sexp` — make the
  self-call NON-tail (`(+ 0 (loop …))`) so it lowers to an ordinary `Core::Call` instead of the loop
  transform; and `miscompile-CONTROL-direct-sum-arg-ok.sexp` — pass the sum handle DIRECTLY (`(one b
  pos)`) rather than projected out of a tuple. So the trigger is precisely the loop back-edge storing a
  tuple-projected sum handle into a param slot. (`W` needs a compound-payload variant so it is a boxed
  i32 handle; a single-variant `W` is newtype-erased to its inner scalar and compiles fine — the earlier
  bisection that fingered "compound variant + if + tuple" was seeing this same loop-transform path.) A
  SECOND surface of the same defect: two sibling `if`-branches each placing an `if` in one Ast-typed
  tuple slot emits INVALID wasm ("expected i64, found i32") — `repros/miscompile-two-sibling-ifs-
  invalid-wasm.sexp`. This is what blocks `decode` today: `read-leaf`/`read-struct` return
  `(tuple <sum> pos)` and the decode loops thread the projected sum through a self-tail recursion.
