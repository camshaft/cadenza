//! `lower` — the query that fills the core column: for a node's `StructId`, its A-normal [`Core`]
//! form.
//!
//! One concern: lowering the resolved tree to the A-normal core. [`core_of`] reads a node's resolved
//! form (via [`crate::resolve::resolved_of`]) and produces its core form, memoizing into `db.core`;
//! it is the ONLY module that fills that column. Where a lowering decision needs the solved type it
//! READS it (via [`crate::infer::type_of`]) rather than recomputing one
//! (`reference-compiler.md` §One Pass Owns One Concern) — Stage 0's structural lowering does not yet
//! branch on the type, but the read is available so the read-off discipline holds as constructs grow.
//!
//! For the Stage-0 slice every leaf is already an atom, so lowering is close to a structural map: a
//! literal → a `Const*`, an `if` → a core `If` referencing the same child ids (lowered on their own
//! demand). No administrative binding is introduced yet (nothing non-atomic to name); those, and the
//! core's own fresh-id space, arrive with the stage that first needs them.
