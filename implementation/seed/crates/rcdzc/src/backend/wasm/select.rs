//! `select` — instruction selection for the wasm backend: the core (A-normal, structured) form of a
//! definition body linearized into a flat `Vec<Lir>`.
//!
//! This is the wasm backend's linearization of the core (`backends-and-targets.md` §A Backend
//! Linearizes The Core Only If Its Target Is Linear). It reads a node's core form (via
//! [`crate::lower::core_of`]) and its solved type (via [`crate::infer::type_of`]) — the machine
//! representation is a READ-OFF of the solved type (`reference-compiler.md` §A Value's Machine
//! Representation Follows Its Solved Type At Selection), not a guess from the node's shape. It is
//! where a deferred integer width GROUNDS to its machine width, and where a literal that does not fit
//! its solved width DECLINES rather than emitting a truncated value.
//!
//! A construct the flat rung cannot express declines (`reference-compiler.md` §A Guarded Operation
//! Reserves Bounded Scratch Or Declines). Stage 0's slice — a constant, a two-way `if` — lowers to a
//! constant push and a structured `if`/`else`/`end`, so nothing declines here yet.
