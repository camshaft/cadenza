//! `infer` — the query that fills the type column: for a node's `StructId`, its solved [`Ty`].
//!
//! One concern: type determination. [`type_of`] solves one node's type, reading its resolved form
//! (via [`crate::resolve::resolved_of`], which fills the resolved column on demand) and, for a
//! compound node, its children's types (each a lazy `type_of`). It memoizes into `db.types` and is
//! the ONLY module that fills it (`reference-compiler.md` §Types Are Solved Once And Read
//! Downstream). Asking one node's type solves only the nodes that answer reaches — the query stays
//! demand-driven.
//!
//! Stage 0 is monomorphic: a literal's type is a signed integer of DEFERRED width (numeric-literal
//! polymorphism — inference or the backend grounds it), a boolean is `Bool`, an `if` is the join of
//! its branches, and a poison is `Ty::Any` (compatible with everything, so a "no" never cascades
//! into a spurious mismatch). Real Hindley-Milner slots in behind this same `type_of` seam later.
//!
//! [`type_errors`] is a SEPARATE query — a read over the (demand-filled) type column that reports
//! type-agreement faults (an `if` whose condition is not `Bool`, or whose branches disagree). Keeping
//! the fault check apart from the value fill is what lets filling a type never reject and a later
//! rewrite preserve both the value and its checks (`reference-compiler.md` §A Meaning-Preserving
//! Rewrite Preserves Value And Checks).
