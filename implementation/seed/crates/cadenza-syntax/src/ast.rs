//! The AST: two flat arenas — the interface between syntax and compiler.
//!
//! The tree is NOT nested and NOT one arena. It splits **leaf values** from **structure**:
//!
//! - The **leaf pool** holds the distinct primitive values, DEDUPLICATED. A name or literal used
//!   500 times is one entry. Leaves carry no source spans. `LeafId` indexes it.
//! - The **structure arena** holds one entry per SYNTACTIC OCCURRENCE, NOT deduplicated. An entry
//!   is an `Atom(LeafId)` or a `List` of child `StructId`s. `StructId` indexes it; `root` is the
//!   top occurrence.
//!
//! Why the split: it dissolves the occurrence/span problem. A shared node in a nested tree would
//! have many source positions (its span depends on the path taken to reach it). Here the only
//! deduplicated things are leaves, and leaves have no spans; every syntactic occurrence is its own
//! `StructId`, so a span table is a trivial total map `StructId -> range` (see `spans.rs`).
//!
//! A construct is a `List` whose first child is an `Atom` of a `Name` — e.g. `(if c t e)`. There
//! is no dedicated variant per construct: keywords are data, so a new construct is a new head
//! *name*, never a change to this frozen shape. This is what keeps the AST stable and macro
//! pre-expansion (rewriting uniform `(head child…)` structure) easy.
