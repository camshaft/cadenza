`Oracle/Type.lean` — the Lean TYPE-SYSTEM oracle (design: DESIGN-lean-type-system-oracle.md).

The COMPLEMENT to the semantics oracle: an independent typing judgment that validates rcdzc's ACCEPT/REJECT
decision. The fuzzer drives it on rcdzc's REJECTED programs — a Lean-ACCEPTS over a coded reject is a
FALSE-REJECT (an over-strict compiler bug), the false-reject blind spot the wasm-vs-rust differential can
never see (a shared-frontend decline makes both backends agree). "Oracles in both directions."

This file is Phase T0.1: the verdict algebra (§1.1), the all-declining `infer` (HM inference lands at T1),
and `judgeTypecheck` — the §1.2 differential classification mapping a `(TypeVerdict, RcdzcVerdict)` pair onto
the EXISTING `holds`/`mismatch`/`skip` protocol (so the fuzzer↔Lean wire needs no verdict-protocol change).

/-- A Cadenza type over the modeled subset (`spec/capabilities/type-system.md`). Minimal HM skeleton for
the T0.1 declining stage; extended (rows, sums, units, effects) as inference lands at T1+. -/
inductive Ty where
  | int (width : Nat) (signed : Bool)   -- fixed-width integers (I8…I64/U8…U64)
  | bool | unit | string | char
  | fn (dom cod : Ty)                   -- curried function
  | tuple (elts : List Ty)
  | var (id : Nat)                      -- a unification (type) variable
  deriving BEq, Inhabited

/-- A CDZ diagnostic code (e.g. `"CDZ0203"`), carried on a coded reject. -/
abbrev Code := String

/-- The oracle's typing verdict (design §1.1): a pure, total function's output. -/
inductive TypeVerdict where
  | wellTyped (τ : Ty)            -- accepts; `τ` = the principal type (compared only at T4)
  | illTyped (code : Code)        -- rejects with a specific CDZ diagnostic code
  | unsupported (reason : String) -- the oracle declines to model this program (a SOUND coverage gap)
  deriving Inhabited

/-- rcdzc's frontend `cdz check` verdict, carried in the `(typecheck …)` batch item (design §1.2/§1.3):
`accept` / `reject(code)` (a CODED error-severity fault) / `decline` (a CODELESS "not yet implemented"). -/
inductive RcdzcVerdict where
  | accept
  | reject (code : Code)
  | decline
  deriving BEq, Inhabited

/-- The type oracle (T0.1: ALL-DECLINING). Returns `Unsupported` for every program — a sound coverage gap
(the additive baseline starts all-`skip`). HM name-resolution + unification inference lands at T1. -/
def infer (_ : Ast.Module) : TypeVerdict :=
  .unsupported "type oracle: infer not yet implemented (T0.1 declining skeleton)"

/-- The differential classification (design §1.2): map the oracle's verdict against rcdzc's carried
accept/reject/decline onto `holds`/`mismatch`/`skip`. A `mismatch` names the direction so cdz-smith triages
without re-deriving. `Unsupported` on the oracle side is ALWAYS a `skip` (a sound coverage gap — growing
coverage can only ADD checks, never create a false alarm). Code parity on an agreed reject is deferred to
T3 (both-reject ⇒ `holds` here, regardless of code). -/
